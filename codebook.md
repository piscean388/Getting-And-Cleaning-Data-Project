## Codebook - Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The set of variables in the tidy data set are: 

subject: an id representing each subject
activity: one of the following 6 activities 
		* WALKING
		*
 WALKING_UPSTAIRS

		* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		*
 SITTING

		* STANDING
		*
 LAYING

mean: Mean value of the feature/variable for each subject and activity 
std: Standard deviation of the feature/variable averaged per subject and activity
meanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components for each subject and activity
