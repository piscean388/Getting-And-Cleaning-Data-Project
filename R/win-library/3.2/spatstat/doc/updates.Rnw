   New argument \texttt{emend}, equivalent to \texttt{project}.

  \item \texttt{predict.kppm, residuals.kppm}
   Now issues a warning when the calculation ignores the 
   cluster/Cox component and treats the model as if it were Poisson.
   (This currently happens in predict.kppm when se=TRUE or interval != "none",
   and in residuals.kppm when type != "raw").

   \item \texttt{progressreport}
   New argument \texttt{state}
   New option: \verb!style="tk"!

   Accelerated, when \texttt{P} is a single number.

   \item \texttt{rThomas, rMatClust, rCauchy, rVarGamma}

   This avoids computations which would require huge amounts of memory. 
   New argument \texttt{poisthresh} controls this behaviour.


      \item Simulation:
   Several basic simulation algorithms have been accelerated.
   Consequently, simulation outcomes are not identical to 
   those obtained with previous versions of \spst, even when the

   previous versions of \spst.

   Improved behaviour when there are more than 2 windows.

   \item \texttt{update}: now works for models of class \texttt{"mppm"}.
     
   \item \texttt{update.kppm}:
   Now handles additional arguments in any order, with or without names.
   Changed arguments. Improved behaviour.

   \item \texttt{valid.ppm}
   This is now a method for the generic function \texttt{valid}.

   whether to remove unused levels of a factor.

 \end{itemize}

which currently produces a list of \Sexpr{nbugs} bugs,
of which \Sexpr{nbugssince} were detected after publication of the
book \cite{baddrubaturn15}.

Following is a list of the {\bf most serious bugs} only, in order
of potential impact.

\newcommand\bugger[4]{%
  \\  {} %
  {\small (Bug introduced in \texttt{spatstat {#1}}, {#2}; %
    fixed in \texttt{spatstat {#3}}, {#4})}%
}
  
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{nncross.ppp}:

  Results were completely incorrect if $k > 1$.
  \bugger{1.31-2}{april 2013}{1.35-0}{december 2013}

\item \texttt{nncross.pp3}:
  Results were completely incorrect in some cases.
  \bugger{1.32-0}{august 2013}{1.34-0}{october 2013}

\item \texttt{rmh}:
  
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Simulation was completely incorrect in the case of 
     a multitype point process with an interaction that does not depend
     on the marks, such as \verb!ppm(betacells, ~marks, Strauss(60))!
     due to a coding error in the \texttt{C} interface.
     \bugger{1.22-3}{march 2010}{1.22-3}{june 2011}
   \item 
     Simulation of the Area-Interaction model was completely incorrect.
     \bugger{1.23-6}{october 2011}{1.31-0}{january 2013}
   \item 
     Simulation of the Geyer saturation process was completely incorrect.
     \bugger{1.31-0}{january 2013}{1.31-1}{march 2013}
   \item 
     Simulation of the Strauss-Hard Core process was partially incorrect,
     giving point patterns with a slightly lower intensity.
     \bugger{1.31-0}{january 2013}{1.37-0}{may 2014}
   \item
   The result of simulating a model with a hard core
   did not necessarily respect the hard core constraint,
   and simulation of a model with strong inhibition
   did not necessarily converge. 
   This only happened if the first order trend was large,
   the starting state (\texttt{n.start} or \texttt{x.start}) was not given,
   and the number of iterations \texttt{nrep} was not very large.
   It occurred because of a poor choice for the default starting state.
   {\small (Bug was present since about 2010.  
     Fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.40-0}, december 2014)}
   \item 
     Simulation was incorrect in the case of an inhomogeneous multitype model
     with \texttt{fixall=TRUE} (i.e.\ with a fixed number of points 
     of each type) if the model was segregated (i.e.\ if different types
     of points had different first order trend). 
     The effect of the error was that all types of points
     had the same first order trend.
     {\small (Bug was present since about 2010.
       Fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.43-0}, september 2015)}
  \item 
     Simulation of the Geyer saturation process was 
     incorrectly initialised, so that the results of a short run 
     (i.e. small value of \texttt{nrep}) were incorrect, 
     while long runs were correct.
     \bugger{1.17-0}{october 2009}{1.31-1}{march 2013}
   \end{itemize}
   
\item \texttt{nncross}, \texttt{distfun}, \texttt{AreaInter}:
  Results of \texttt{nncross} were possibly incorrect 
  when \code{X} and \code{Y} did not have the same window. 
  This bug affected values of \texttt{distfun} and may also 
  have affected ppm objects with interaction \texttt{AreaInter}.
  \bugger{1.9-4}{june 2006}{1.25-2}{january 2012}

 \item \texttt{update.ppm}:
   If the argument \texttt{Q} was given,
   the results were usually incorrect, or an error was generated.
   \bugger{1.38-0}{august 2014}{1.38-1}{august 2014}
     
\item \texttt{envelope.ppm}:
   If the model was an inhomogeneous Poisson process, 
   the resulting envelope object was incorrect
   (the simulations were correct, but the envelopes were calculated
   assuming the model was CSR).

    \bugger{1.20-2}{august 2010}{1.33-0}{september 2013}
    
 \item \texttt{ppm}:
   Results were incorrect for the Geyer saturation model
   with a non-integer value of the saturation parameter \texttt{sat}.
   \bugger{1.20-0}{july 2010}{1.31-2}{april 2013}
   
 \item \texttt{lppm}:
   For multitype patterns, the fitted model was completely incorrect
   due to an error in constructing the quadrature scheme.
   \bugger{1.23-0}{july 2011}{1.30-0}{december 2012}
   
 \item \texttt{Geyer}:
   For point process models with the \texttt{Geyer} interaction,

   \bugger{1.27-0}{may 2012}{1.29-0}{october 2012}
   
 \item \texttt{linearK}, \texttt{linearKinhom}:
   If any data points were located exactly at a vertex of the 
   linear network, the weights for Ang's correction were incorrect, 
   due to numerical error. This sometimes produced infinite 
   or NA values of the linear $K$ function.  
   \bugger{1.23-0}{july 2011}{1.27-0}{may 2012}

 \item \texttt{Kinhom}, \texttt{Linhom}:
   the results were not renormalised (even if \texttt{renormalise=TRUE})
   in some cases.
   \bugger{1.21-0}{december 2010}{1.37-0}{may 2014}

   \bugger{1.39-0}{october 2014}{1.40-0}{december 2014}

  \item \texttt{markcorrint}:
   Results were completely incorrect.
   \bugger{1.39-0}{october 2014}{1.40-0}{december 2014}

 \item \texttt{Kinhom}, \texttt{Linhom}:
   Calculations were incorrect if \texttt{lambda} was a fitted point
   process model.
   \bugger{1.38-0}{august 2014}{1.38-1}{august 2014}
     
 \item \texttt{predict.ppm}:
   Calculation of the conditional intensity omitted the edge correction
   if \texttt{correction='translate'} or \texttt{correction='periodic'}. 
   \bugger{1.17-0}{october 2009}{1.31-3}{may 2013}

 \item \texttt{varblock}:
   Calculations were incorrect if more than one column of 
   edge corrections was computed. 
   \bugger{1.21-1}{november 2010}{1.39-0}{october 2014}
   
 \item \texttt{scan.test}
   Results were sometimes incorrect due to numerical instability
   (a 'Gibbs phenomenon').    
   \bugger{1.24-1}{october 2011}{1.26-1}{april 2012}

 \item \texttt{relrisk}:
   When \verb!at="pixels"!, a small fraction of pixel values were sometimes
   wildly inaccurate, due to numerical errors. This affected the 
   range of values in the result, and therefore the appearance of plots.
   {\small (Bug fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.40-0}, december 2014)}

 \item \texttt{selfcrossing.psp}:
   $y$ coordinate values were incorrect.

   was larger than the original domain.
   \bugger{1.21-0}{november 2010}{1.25-3}{february 2012}
   
 \item \texttt{Lest}:
   The variance approximations (Lotwick-Silverman and Ripley)
   obtained with \texttt{var.approx=TRUE} were incorrect for \texttt{Lest}
   (although they were correct for \texttt{Kest}) due to a coding error.
   \bugger{1.24-1}{october 2011}{1.24-2}{november 2011}
 
 \item \texttt{bw.diggle}:
   Bandwidth was too large by a factor of 2.
   \bugger{1.23-4}{september 2011}{1.23-5}{september 2011}
 
 \item pair correlation functions (\texttt{pcf.ppp}, \texttt{pcfdot}, 
    \texttt{pcfcross} etc:)
    The result had a negative bias at the maximum $r$ value,
    because contributions to the pcf estimate from interpoint distances
    greater than \texttt{max(r)} were mistakenly omitted. 
    {\small (Bugs fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.35-0}, december 2013)}
    
 \item \texttt{Kest}, \texttt{Lest}:
   Gave incorrect values in very large datasets, due to numerical overflow.
   `Very large' typically means about 1 million points in a random pattern, 
   or 100,000 points in a tightly clustered pattern.
   [Overflow cannot occur unless there are at least 46,341 points.]
   
 \item \texttt{bw.relrisk}:
    Implementation of \texttt{method="weightedleastsquares"} was incorrect

\item \texttt{crosspairs}:
   If \texttt{X} and \texttt{Y} were identical point patterns,
   the result was not necessarily symmetric
   (on some machines) due to numerical artifacts.
   \bugger{1.35-0}{december 2013}{1.44-0}{december 2015}

 \item \texttt{bdist.tiles}:
   Values were incorrect in some cases due to numerical error.
    {\small (Bug fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.29-0}, october 2012)}
   
\item \texttt{Kest.fft}:
  Result was incorrectly normalised.
   \bugger{1.21-2}{january 2011}{1.44-0}{december 2015}
  
\item \texttt{crossdist.ppp}:
  Ignored argument \texttt{squared} if \texttt{periodic=FALSE}.
    {\small (Bug fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.38-0}, july 2014)}

\item polygon geometry:
    The point-in-polygon test gave the wrong answer in some boundary cases.
    {\small (Bug fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.23-2}, august 2011)}

\item \texttt{MultiStraussHard}:
    If a fitted model with \texttt{MultiStraussHard} interaction was invalid,
    \texttt{project.ppm} sometimes yielded a model that was still invalid.
    {\small (Bug fixed in \texttt{spatstat 1.42-0}, may 2015)}
    
\item \texttt{pool.envelope}:  
  Did not always respect the value of \texttt{use.theory}.

  Sometimes caused a segmentation fault.
    \bugger{1.44-0}{december 2015}{1.44-1}{december 2015}

\item \texttt{anova.ppm}:
  If a single \texttt{object} was given, and it was a Gibbs model,
  then \texttt{adjust} was effectively set to \texttt{FALSE}.
